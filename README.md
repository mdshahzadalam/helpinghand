Searching and Filtering: The main search bar allows users to input specific criteria such as location, property type, and budget. Additional filters provide options for more granular control, helping users pinpoint listings that meet their needs.

Viewing Listings: Each listing includes detailed information, including descriptions, property features, pricing, and photos. Users can browse through images to get a closer look at the property before reaching out to landlords or property managers.

Saving and Shortlisting Properties: Users can add listings to their “Favorites” for easy access and comparison. This feature is particularly helpful for people who want to explore multiple options before making a final decision.
